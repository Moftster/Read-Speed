  <h1> ReadSpeed.com </h1>

  <p class=para-text> Welcome to ReadSpeed.com
    The site where we calculate how fast you read
    and reccomend books for you based on how much
    time you have to read.


  </p>

  <h2 class="heading-text">How does it work?</h2>
  <p>Read speed works by timing you to read a paticular segment of text, it then works our your Read Speed Per Minute (RSPM)<p>

<h2 class="heading-text"> How long does it take</h2>
  <p>It will take as long as it takes you to read the block of text! Less than 1 minute for the majority of people.</p>
